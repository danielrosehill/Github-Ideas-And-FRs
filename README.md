#  Github: Ideas & Feature Requests

## Purpose Statement

Sometimes I contribute ideas and feature requests to projects on Github that I care about and enjoy. 

As this data isn't covered in my current backup pool, I decided to create my own repository to stage these in. This also gives me a bit of a drafting space to bring these to fruition before contributing them to the actual projects. 

I'll organize these according to the project they relate to (as folders).

Like most feature requests, these are written pretty casually and informally.
